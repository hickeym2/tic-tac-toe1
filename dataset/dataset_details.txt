		ttt = tic-tac-toe grid

		[ttt_top_left, ttt_top_middle, ttt_top_right, ttt_middle_left, ttt_middle_middle, ttt_middle_right, ttt_bottom_left, ttt_bottom_middle, ttt_bottom_right, outcome]

		Epoch structure
			0: 	The north west corner slot of the ttt grid.
			1: 	The north slot of the ttt grid.
			2: 	The north east corner slot of the ttt grid.
			3:  The west slot of the ttt grid.
			4:	The center slot of the ttt grid.
			5:  The east slot of the ttt grid.
			6:  The south west corner slot of the ttt grid.
			7:	The south slot of the ttt grid.
			8:  The south east corner slot of the ttt grid.
			9:  The outcome of the game. 

		Epoch Contents
			0 = blank slot, 1 = player "x", 2 = player "o", 3 = Tie.

		Example:
			A game whose outcome produced the following array of data,
			[2	0	1	2	1	2	1	1	0	1]

			Would produce a ttt table of

			  o |   | x
			------------
			  o | x | o
			------------
			  x | x |   

			 And the winner is x
